# CRCM

## Client

### Known issues

- cli is in /client, use `node crcm-cli.js --help` for usage info
- use revision instead of version (version is already used by yargs)
- if stored token (.token) is invalid please log again
- Configurators (Users) should be created via the loopback explorer beforehand
- get does not support not passing version
